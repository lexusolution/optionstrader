## Dependencies and Critical Path

### Critical Dependencies
1. Oracle DB must be set up before any data collection scripts
2. Data collection must be working before Azure API development
3. Azure APIs must be functioning before dashboard UI integration
4. All components must be tested individually before end-to-end testing

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement robust error handling in all scripts
- Create fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Set up monitoring and alerts for critical components
- Test regularly during development, not just at the end
